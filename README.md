# galaga

For my project, I have recreated a version of "Galaga." The user controls the player at the bottom of the screen and the main objective is to hit as many enemies to gain points without getting hit. The player has 4 lives and enemies can have multiple lives depending which type they are. 

Run the python code named "tp.py". All the pictures and the .txt files needed should be in the zip file ("TP.zip"). 

There is no need to install any libraries. There are no shortcut commands.
